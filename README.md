## HTML
The idea here is to have all of the tabs linked to one another, but keep the NavBar consistent. Then to give paragraphs and photos a narrow, picture frame style; giving an artistic as well as legible appearance. 

Other notable changes:
* Used the "Hidden Brand" Toggler from https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/
* Took out "navbar light" as well as other class components to customize the background image and font. 
* Once customized, I copied and pasted the NavBar to the other tabs and connected them. 
* Utilized the card component in bootstrap for main profile. 

## CSS
Here I inputed several background images and commented out the other ones. This will provide future versatility for special events or seasonal appearances. Adding personal images to add personality to each tab is also important! This porfolio will represent me; so I will be adjusting several times throughout the course and I hope to make it more aesthetically appealing over time!

Other notable changes:
* Consolidated syntax to keep style uniform thoughtout the pages. 
* Needed to add space between code to differentiate different background images.
* consolidated the white background color for the bio card.
